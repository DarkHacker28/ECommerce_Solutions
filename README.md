## Installation

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7+ or higher
- MySQL database
- A local development environment like XAMPP or WAMP (or any preferred web server)
- A code editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-commerce-solution.git
    cd e-commerce-solution
    ```

2. **Set up your database:**
    - Create a new MySQL database and import the SQL schema file (located at `database/schema.sql`).
    - Update the database configuration in `config.php` with your database credentials.

    ```php
    // config.php
    define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
    define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
    define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
    define('DB_NAME', 'ecommerce_db');
    ```

3. **Configure the project:**
    - Make sure the following files are correctly set up:
        - `config.php` for database connection
        - `.htaccess` for clean URL routing (optional)
        - Set file permissions for any writable directories like `uploads/` or `logs/` if required.

4. **Run the project:**
    - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/e-commerce-solution` (or the correct URL based on your local setup).
    - The homepage should load, and you can start testing the features.

### Database Schema

You can find the SQL schema for the database in the `database/schema.sql` file. This includes tables for users, products, orders, categories, and others needed for the platform.

Example schema for the `products` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `products` (
  `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `description` TEXT,
  `price` DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  `category_id` INT NOT NULL,
  `image` VARCHAR(255),
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`category_id`) REFERENCES `categories`(`id`)
);
